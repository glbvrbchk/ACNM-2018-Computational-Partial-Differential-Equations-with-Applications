%(a) For what reason is the variable N2 introduced? (Clearly, we could have just used N^2 wherever needed instead.)
%N is reducing computational cost. There is no point to calculate it every
%time in the code.

%(b) Is A a sparse matrix or a full matrix? Why?
%A matrix is the diagonal matrix that have matrix B on every diagonal
%entry. Matrix B is the sparce diagonal matrix that have ones on lower and
%upper diagonal and -4 on upper diagonal.

%(c) Why does the approximate solution not appear to be zero at the boundary? Try increasing N to N = 100.
%What do you observe happening near the boundary? Explain.
%with incresing N, step h is increasing, error decreasing which is lead solution to the
%boundary.
